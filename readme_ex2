as an administrator of a university department and we have to determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their
results on two exams. Having the historical data from previous applicants it can be used as a training set for logistic regression. 
For each training example, we have the applicant's scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
The task was to build a classification model that estimates an applicant's probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.
