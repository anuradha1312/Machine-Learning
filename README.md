Here linear regressionis implemented with one variable to predict profts for a food truck(Supposing there's is a restaurant franchise and
considering diferent cities for opening a new outlet.) The chain already has trucks in various cities and having the data for
profits and populations from the cities this data is used to select which city to have the business expanded next.
The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second 
column is the proft of a food truck in that city. A negative value for proft indicates a loss.
